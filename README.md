## ✨ What is LlamaBot?

LlamaBot is an open-source AI agent built on **LangGraph** and **FastAPI**. It helps you:

* 💬 Chat to write HTML/CSS/JS
* ⚙️ Operate directly inside your real software (like Rails apps)
* 🔁 Automate business logic using existing models, services, and routes

There are two primary ways to use LlamaBot:

1. **🧪 Try the interactive HTML/JS agent** – see the magic in your browser
2. **⚙️ Embed it in your backend app (e.g. Rails)** – let it run real workflows

---

## 🚀 Option 1: Try the HTML/JS Agent (No setup)

Perfect for:

* Mini-games (Canvas-based)
* Static websites
* Marketing pages
* Interactive calculators

```bash
# Run via Docker
# (only requirement: Docker and your OpenAI key)
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... -p 8000:8000 kody06/llamabot-backend
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/chat
```

---

## 🧩 Option 2: Embed the Agent in Your App (Rails, Django, Laravel, etc.) 
Rails is our primary use case right now, others coming soon!

LlamaBot also works as a **CodeAct-style embedded agent**. That means it can:

* Operate inside your existing web app
* Query your real ActiveRecord/ORM models
* Trigger existing services and codepaths
* Send emails, enqueue jobs, and more
* Learn about your app and remember key workflows to trigger

**Demo use cases:**

* Refund a user and notify them by SMS
* Generate a weekly revenue report
* Queue 100 Sidekiq jobs from natural language

**Add Rails adapter to your app:**

* [`llama_bot_rails`](https://github.com/kodykendall/llama_bot_rails) gem
* Point to the same backend (via Docker)
* Whitelist safe routes and tools using your existing RBAC (Devise, Pundit, etc.)

```rb
# config/initializers/llama_bot.rb
LlamaBotRails.configure do |config|
  config.api_base_url = ENV["LLAMABOT_BACKEND_URL"]
  config.allowed_routes = {
    "send_sms" => { verb: :post, path: "/agent/users/:id/send_sms" },
    "refund_order" => { verb: :post, path: "/agent/orders/:id/refund" }
  }
end
```

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

* Built on **LangGraph** (multi-step agent workflows)
* Streaming responses via **FastAPI + WebSocket**
* Memory saved and scoped to conversation / session
* Can call external tools via APIs or internal app methods (via HTTP calls)
